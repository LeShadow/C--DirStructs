C--DirStructs
=============

I started learning C++ at the beginning of this year. I wrote some small code of my own, just to exercise.
Gradually we received larger assignments at the university. After a while I was confused on how I should structure my code files to keep my project directory clean and easy to navigate through.

So I went on a search...

I searched for people who had the same problem and who asked for advice or tips to other people. Most of the time, those people received some useful tips/advice and I started to store those.

I decided then to create a repository with example directory structures that came out of those pages I viewed so people wouldn't have to look further and could just browse this repository to find a directory structure that perfectly fitted their needs.

I added two examples today, I'll add more when I find more useful ones. If you have a suggestion, feel free to post them in an issue, or send me a message :).
